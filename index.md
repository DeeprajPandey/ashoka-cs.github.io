## Computer Science Society, Ashoka University

## Welcome, random Internet user!

You are currently staring at what is the official website of the Computer Science Society at [Ashoka University], a not-for-profit liberal arts institution located in Sonepat, Haryana, India.

### Who we are

The Computer Science Society at Ashoka is aimed at promoting, educating and encouraging Ashokans, irrespective of stream, to take greater interest in the field of computer science, technology, and primarily programming. The society has an organisational structure with members elected to official posts on an annual basis.

### What we do

We organise activities on campus on a regular basis, such as hackathons, cryptic hunts, tutorials, and tournaments, among others. We also take the responsibility of officiating preliminary rounds for teams from our college that participate in events such as the ACM Inter Collegiate Programming Contest.

### We share our code, too

You will find the code for projects that we build for use by the entire campus in our [GitHub](https://github.com/ashoka-cs) repository.

### Happy to help
